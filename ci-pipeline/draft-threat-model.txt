             SCITT Threat Model and Security Considerations
                       draft-threat-model-latest

Abstract

   SCITT Threat Model document does an extensive analysis of possible
   threats to SCITT building blocks and overall threats to the SCITT
   System.  This document is to be read in tandem to the SCITT
   Architecture Document.

1.  INTRODUCTION

   This document provides the information about the threats that were
   considered for SCITT, and also discusses possible mitigation
   strategies.  This will lead to defining the security requirements for
   the SCITT Architecture.

   It also clearly defines certain threats that are out of scope of the
   SCITT.

2.  System Level Threats

   *  Denial of Service:

   An attacker may flood any part of SCITT Eco System that prohibits
   correct users from using the system.

   *  Information Disclosure:

   A third party may be able to extract sesitive information from SCITT
   Eco System, example either from SCITT append only log or from
   receipts that are confidential.

   *  Loss of Credentials:

   An attacker may get access to the credentials of a specific actor and
   can perform its roles incorrectly.  For example, a rogue actor
   getting access to auditor credentials and generating false audit
   reports for the SCITT Claims.

3.  Component Level Threats

   The threats are categorized based on the individual building blocks
   that comprise the SCITT Architecture.

3.1.  Identity Threats

   *  False Identity

   *  Stolen Identity

3.2.  Threats to Transparency Service

   *  Refuse or delay registration of claims

   *  Register claims that do not pass its registration policy

   *  Issue verifiable receipts for claims that do not match its log

   *  Provide log access to only limited actors within a set of
      authorized actors

   *  Provide log access to unauthorized actors

   *  Presenting a forked view of log to only a sub-set of users

   *  Provide access to unrelated claims to authorized third parties

   *  Unauthorized access to policy documents, that control the
      behaviour of the log

3.3.  Threats to Independent Verifiers

   *  Compromised Verification Logic

   *  Usage of incorrect receipts during verification

4.  Out of Scope

   The following threats does impact SCITT Eco System but they are
   covered by other WG, hence out of scope from SCITT perspective.

   *  SCITT append only logs running compromised Hardware, Firmware or
      Software If the log operation is compromised due to any of th
      above been compromised, then Remote Attestation of the log
      servers, as defined in IETF RATS should address the same.

   *  Incorrect use of security practices
